# Case_File: 

A custom 404 page inspired by the 1995 classic anime **Neon Genesis Evangelion**

## The Concept
In the event of a system breach or a requested data-string that does not exist within the NERV archives, the MAGI (Melchior, Balthasar, Casper) initiate a **Level 1 Intervention**. 

This page treats the 404 error as a critical synchronization failure. The user's request has been intercepted by the MAGI override, indicating that the pilot's "Ego Border" has collapsed or the requested memory address is restricted under NERV Priority AAA security protocols.

God's in his heaven. All's right with the world.
